# MathOperations Test
This project showcases how to implement unit testing in Java with JUnit 5. It includes a MathOperations class with basic mathematical operations, along with unit tests for each method, parameterized tests to test multiple input cases, and a test suite to group and run all tests together.

The MathOperations class provides the following functionalities:

- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor): Calculates the GCD of two numbers.
- Prime Number Check: Checks if a number is prime.
- Factorial: Calculates the factorial of a number.
